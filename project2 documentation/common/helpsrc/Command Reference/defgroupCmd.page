/** 
\page defgroupCmd 
!!! Define a group documentaion block
This command defines a group, much like a page (pageCmd) or unit (unitCmd). 
The difference is that groups can contain C/C++ entities as well as other groups. 
Actually you can put anything in a group. 


Syntax:
\code
\defgroup MyGroup
\defgroup "Group name with spaces"
\endcode


Groups are tied to the directory they are specified in and have their own 'tab' 
on directory pages. They can also be enabled to show up on the left menu (default on).

!! Group members
Adding members to a group can be done in two ways. 
-# Using the \\ingroup MyGroup (ingroupCmd) in the documentation block of another entity 
   you want as member of the MyGroup group.
-# Using the \\inthisgroup MyFunction (inthisgroupCmd) within the groups documentation block. 
   It's ok to use both methods. In that case \\inthisgroup mainly is used to specify the #order# 
   of the members in the group, see config option SORT_GROUP_MEMBERS.

!! Order of groups and group members
If you choose to use groups you may want to be able to specify a non alphabetized order (default) for 
the group members. This can be done by setting the config option $SORT_GROUP_MEMBERS = NO$ which causes 
the group members to be ordered in the same order as they appear in the source files. In case this order 
is not what you want you can also use the \\inthisgroup (inthisgroupCmd) to specify the order of the members. 

The order of the actual groups can also be altered from the default alphabetized order by setting 
$SORT_GROUPS = NO$ . To get a custom order simply make sure you order the \\defgroup blocks in the 
order desired.

\note Autolinking to group names with spaces. Remember to put the group name in quotation marks 
      to name groups in the place where you refer to the group just like with directories. E.g. 
      '... you can also go to "My group with spaces" to see the ....'
