/** 
\page examplesgroupCmd 
!!! Define a examples group documentaion block
This command defines a examples group, much like a page (defgroupCmd) or unit (unitCmd). 
The difference is that example groups can contain source code examples which are related 
to the directory in which the groups is defined. 


!Syntax:
\code
\examplesgroup MyGroup
\examplesgroup "Group name with spaces"
\endcode

Example groups are tied to the directory they are specified in and have their own 'tab' 
on directory pages (far right).  

!Layout
To control the layout we have the EXAMPLE_GROUP_USE_TABS option, which controls wheter 
the examples are show as classic overview tables or using tab for each example group, and 
again a tab for each example within a group. Default is to show using tabs. 
For the standard examples both in example groups and all other entities we also 
have two options for showing the examples using EXAMPLES_USE_TABS. If set to 
YES (default), DoxyS will display examples on all pages as tabs. If set to NO 
examples will be shown (classical) using expand/collapse icons.

!Adding examples to a group
Examples are added to an example group like examples for classes, pages, functions etc. 
using the \\example (exampleCmd) command. 

!DoxyS.ignore
When including examples using a line like this:
\code
\example _examples/included_example_1.cpp
\endcode
It might a good idea to exclude the '_examples' directory using a 'DoxyS.ignore' 
file with content like this:
\code
_examples
\endcode


\example
/**
\examplesgroup "My examples"
This is the breif description of the examples group.
More description here.

\ example
void someFunction()
{
	float iFloat = 10.4;
	OverloadedInGroup( iFloat );
	Set( iFloat, 4.5 );
}

\note Autolinking to examples group names with spaces. Remember to put the examples group name in quotation marks 
      to name groups in the place where you refer to the examples group just like with directories. E.g. 
      '... you can also go to "My examples group with spaces" to see the ....'
