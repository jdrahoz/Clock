/** 
\page inthisgroupCmd 
!!! Add an etity to this group.
This command is used in the documentation block of a group to add members 
and/or to specify the desired order of the members. See all defgroupCmd.
 

Syntax:
\code
\inthisgroup myFun
\inthisgroup "Group name with spaces"
\endcode

!! Order of groups and group members
If you choose to use groups you may want to be able to specify a non alphabetized order (default) for 
the group members. This can be done by setting the config option $SORT_GROUP_MEMBERS = NO$ which causes 
the group members to be ordered in the same order as they appear in the source files. In case this order 
is not what you want you can also use the \\inthisgroup (inthisgroupCmd) to specify the order of the members. 

\see defgroupCmd, ingroupCmd

/**
\defgroup "My own order functions"
